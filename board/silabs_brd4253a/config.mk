# Uncomment, and set path to custom power table here, if set, the custom power
# table will be set during application startup, and the stack will use that
# instead of the default
# For convenience, an example of a +19dBm power table is provided, uncomment the
# line below to use that instead of the default +10dBm power table
# NOTE! +19 dBm power level is usable only where US FCC regulation applies
