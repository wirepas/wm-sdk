 * The System library collects together low-level functions such as interrupt
 * handling, critical sections and power management.
 *
 * The System library also provides a simple periodic callback facility that
 * applications can use in place of a typical main loop, to perform tasks
 * alongside the protocol stack. The periodic callback facility also doubles as
 * a "bottom-half" callback, also known as a slow/soft interrupt handler or
 * deferred procedure call, which can be triggered from interrupts. This allows
 * writing interrupt routines that react to external events quickly and then do
 * the rest of the processing in an application callback whenever it is
 * convenient to do so.
 *
 * Library services are accessed via @ref app_lib_system_t "lib_system"
 * handle.

 * interrupt context. Most of the handling should be done later, in a
 * "bottom-half" handler, also known as a slow/soft interrupt handler, or

 * the @ref app_lib_system_set_periodic_cb_f "lib_system->setPeriodicCb"()
 * function with an initial delay of
 * zero. This causes the periodic callback to be called as soon as possible.
 *
 * If @p fast is false, the interrupt is considered as deferred interrupt. Then,
 * the top half of the interrupt is handled by the stack and interrupt handler
 * (bottom half)  set by the application is called as normal application task
 * context. Then, the top half does not need to be implemented in application.
 * Con is that it calling of the bottom half may be too late and deferred
 * interrupt is not necessarily feasible for all peripherals.
 *
 * Not all interrupts are available for application use. Each supported platform
