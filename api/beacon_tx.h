 *
 * Wirepas  Mesh  stack  is  capable  of  using  the  idle  time  between
 * network  protocol  radio transmissions to transmit Bluetooth LE compatible
 * beacons. The Beacon TX library provides an API for configuring each node to
 * transmit beacons.
 * It is recommended to read document WP-RM-103 - Wirepas Mesh Beacon API
 * Reference Manual for an introduction of beacon support in the Wirepas Mesh
 * stack.
 * The  Beacon  TX  library  is  not  available  on  all  radio  architectures,
 * only supported in 2.4GHz radio architectures.
 *
 * Library services are accessed  via @ref app_lib_beacon_tx_t "lib_beacon_tx"
 * handle.
 *
 * For examples on how to use these services, check out example application
 * @ref ble_beacon/app.c "ble_beacon".
