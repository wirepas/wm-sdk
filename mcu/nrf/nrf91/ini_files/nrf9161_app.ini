; Custom Memory areas that can be defined
;
; On this platform you can use up to 760 kB of internal memory starting at address 0x40000
;
; If you support external memory, you can also define them here with the correct flag.
;
; There is room for 8 areas. Wirepas uses 3 of them so 5 other ones can be defined.
;
; By default, two areas are defined. One to store application and a smaller one to
; store persistent application data.
;
; To override this file, please copy this file under your application folder and override the
; INI_FILE_APP variable (from the application config.mk).
;
; If your application is supported by multiple platforms, do not forget to have a dedicated
; file for each of them.
;
; Flags definition:
; bit 0 : store version numbers in this area (must be 1 for application area and 0 for others
; except if you know what you are doing)
; bit 1 : memory area is located in external flash
; bits 2,3,4 : area type, 0:bootloader, 1:stack, 2:application, 3:persistent, 4:scratchpad, 5:user, 6:modemfw

[area:application]
id      = APP_AREA_ID   ; Area ID, different for each application
address = 0x00044000    ; Start address: right after firmware
length  = 745472        ; Length in bytes: 728 kB, shared with scratchpad
flags   = 0x00000009    ; Store version; internal flash; application

[area:app_persistent]
id      = 0x8AE573BA    ; Area ID, same for all apps/platform by default
address = 0x000FA000    ; Start address: end of app_area - 16 kB
length  = 16384         ; Length in bytes: 16 kB
flags   = 0x00000014    ; internal flash, user
