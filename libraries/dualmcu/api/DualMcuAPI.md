# Introduction

The Wirepas Mesh stack (hereafter referred to as the "stack") provides services
for the application layer (hereafter referred to as the "application"). The
services are exposed via Service Access Points ("SAPs"). The SAPs are divided
into Data SAP (DSAP), Management SAP (MSAP), and Configuration SAP (CSAP). The
SAP services are provided in the form of primitives and SAP data is exposed as
attributes.
All field lengths are in octets (i.e. units of eight bits), unless otherwise
stated.

## Service Access Points

The SAPs provide the following general services:

-   **DSAP**: Provides methods for data transfer to and from the stack (and the
    network)

-   **MSAP**: Provides methods for transferring stack management information and
    reading/writing management attributes. Management attributes provide
    information of the run-time state of the stack and are valid only when the
    stack is running.

-   **CSAP:** Provides methods for reading/writing stack configuration
    attributes. Configuration attributes can only be written when the stack is
    stopped.

Currently, the SAPs are realized as a Universal Asynchronous
Receiver/Transmitter (UART) serial interface.

## Primitive Types

The primitives are divided into four classes: request, confirm, indication, and
response. The general usage of the primitives is as follows (Also see Figure 1):

-   A **request** is issued by the application when it wants to use a stack
    service.

-   A **confirm** is a reply from the stack to the request issued by the
    application.

-   An **indication** is issued by the stack when it has data/information it
    wants to send to the application. In the point of view of the application,
    indications are asynchronous messages from the stack.

-   A **response** is a reply from the application to the indication issued by
    the stack.

*Figure 1. Primitive usage in the communication between the application and the
stack*


Three different use cases can be identified for the above primitives:

1.  Application issues commands to the stack or needs to send data/information.

    1.  Application issues the appropriate **request** primitive.

    2.  The stack responds with corresponding **confirm** primitive to
        acknowledge the request.

2.  Application queries data/information from the stack and the stack responds
    immediately:

    1.  Application issues the appropriate **request** primitive.

    2.  The stack responds with corresponding **confirm** primitive containing
        the requested data/information.

3.  The stack needs to send asynchronous data/information to the application:

    1.  The stack generates appropriate **indication(s)**.

    2.  The stack asserts the Interrupt ReQuest ("IRQ") signal to notify the
        application that it has one or more pending indications.

    3.  The application queries the indications from the stack and acknowledges
        every indication with corresponding **response** primitive.

**Note 1:** Some application requests may generate an immediate response with
which the stack informs that the request has been taken for processing and in
addition optional indication with which the stack informs that the request has
actually been processed.


**Note 2:** The stack indications are always notified via IRQ and can be queried
by the application. The stack never sends data/information to the application on
its own without the application explicitly requesting it. This enables the
application to have full control over the communication between the application
and the stack, and offers full flexibility on the application architecture
(interrupt-based/polling) and scheduling (application can sleep and run its own
tasks when it wants to and communicate with the stack when it wants to). In an
extreme case, e.g. when application MCU pin count is too low, the IRQ signal can
even be omitted and the indication queries can be sent periodically, though this
implementation is not the most energy-efficient nor provides lowest delay
depending on the query interval.

## Attributes

Attributes are small pieces of data that affect the way the stack works, or are
used to inform the application of the state of the stack. Before the stack can
be started in normal operation, a few critical attributes need to be configured
properly (see section [“Required
Configuration”](#Required-Configuration)).
Attributes can either be read-only, readable and writable, or write-only. The
attributes can also be persistent or non-persistent. If the attribute is
persistent, its value will be retained over device power downs and stack stops,
i.e. the value of an attribute is stored in non-volatile memory. Otherwise, the
attribute value will be lost when the device is powered down or the stack
stopped.
Note: Although there are no strict restrictions on how often a persistent
variable can be updated by the application layer, each update causes a tiny bit
of wear on the non-volatile memory. If a persistent variable is to be updated
periodically, updating it less often than once every 30 minutes is recommended.

## Serial Interface Specification

The physical interface between the application MCU and stack MCU is Universal
Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter ("UART"), colloquially called a serial port.
The data is exchanged in frames.

## General Frame Format

The serial frames have similar frame separation mechanism as in SLIP (RFC 1055).
SLIP framing works as follows:

-   Two octet values are reserved: 0xC0, called "END" and 0xDB, called "ESC".

-   A frame begins and ends with octet 0xC0 (END).

-   Any octet of value 0xC0 (END) within the frame is encoded as 0xDB (ESC),
    0xDC.

-   Any octet of value 0xDB (ESC) within the frame is encoded as 0xDB (ESC),
    0xDD.

-   Any other octet is passed through as-is.

In addition, two additional END octets are used to wake up the stack side UART
when starting communication. These END octets are present only when
communicating towards the stack UART. The stack UART will transmit a single END
octet in the beginning of a frame.
The general format of the serial frame is presented in Figure 2. Note that the
different primitives and corresponding content of the payload (thick border in
Figure 2) are specified in section “[Stack Service
Specification](#Stack-Service-Specification)”.
The meaning of the different frame fields is described in Table 1.

*Figure 2. General format of the serial frame*


Table 1. General serial frame fields

| **Field**        | **Size** | **Description**
|------------------|----------|------------------
| *END*            | 1        | Frame separator, octet 0xC0.  Starts and ends a SLIP encoded frame. In addition two extra END-octets are used to wake up the stack side UART when starting communication.
| *Primitive ID*   | 1        | The identified of the used primitive. <p>Different primitives and their primitive identifiers are specified in section [Stack Service Specification](#Stack-Service-Specification). <p>As a general rule: <p>Initiating primitives (request-primitives from the application side and indication-primitives from the stack side) have always the most significant bit set to 0. Responding primitives (confirm-primitives from the stack side and response-primitives from the application side) always have the most significant bit set to 1.  <p> Confirm.primitive_id = 0x80 \| request.primitive_id  Response.primitive_id = 0x80 \| indication.primitive_id
| *Frame ID*       | 1        | Frame identifier. The initiating peer decides the ID and responding peer uses the same value in the response frame:  The application decides the Frame ID for a request-primitive and the stack sends corresponding confirm-primitive with the same Frame ID.  The stack decides the Frame ID for an indication-primitive and the application sends corresponding response-primitive with the same Frame ID.
| *Payload length* | 1        | The following payload length in octets, excluding the CRC octets.
| *Payload*        | *N1*     | The payload of the frame, depends on the primitive in question.  Different primitives and corresponding content of the payload are specified in section [Stack Service Specification](#Stack-Service-Specification).
| *CRC*            | 2        | Checksum over the whole frame that has not been SLIP encoded, excluding the CRC octets. When receiving a frame, the SLIP encoding is removed and the CRC is calculated over the decoded frame. When sending a frame, the CRC is calculated first and SLIP encoding is employed after that.

**Note**: These fields are used only locally for the communication between the
application MCU and the stack. They are not actually transmitted on the network.

## Flow Control

The application MCU is the master in the communication between the application
and the stack.
The stack UART receiver is enabled by two wake up symbols (as described in
section [General Frame
Format](#General-Frame-Format))
and any octets received via UART are processed in an Interrupt Service Routine
(ISR). Thus, no serial interface flow control is required when communicating to
the stack (flow control may be needed in upper level if the stack memory runs
low due to congestion).
Communication is always initiated by the application MCU. Thus, no serial
interface flow control is required in the application direction either.
The stack informs pending indications via an IRQ signal. The IRQ signal is
active low. When the stack has pending indications, the IRQ is asserted, i.e.
the IRQ signal is pulled down. When the stack does not have pending indications,
the IRQ is not asserted, i.e. the IRQ signal is held high.
The usage of request-confirm and indication-response pairs should always be
atomic. This means, that a new request should not be sent before a confirmation
is received for a previous request (application initiated communication) and a
new indication should not be sent before a response is received for a previous
indication (stack initiated communication).

## UART Configuration

UART configuration is defined and configurable in the Dual MCU application.
Default Dual MCU application settings are described in in Table 2.

*Table 2. UART default configuration*

| **Parameter**       | **Value**     |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Baud rate           | 125000 bps    |
| Number of data bits | 8             |
| Parity              | No parity bit |
| Number of stop bits | 1             |

## Endianness and Bit Order

Multi-octet fields are transferred least significant octet first (i.e.
little-endian).
Octets are transferred most significant bit first.

## Timing

There is a reception timeout for received UART frames. A transmission of
complete API frame to the stack MCU shall take no longer than 450 ms.

## CRC Calculation (CRC-16-CCITT)

The used CRC type is CRC-16-CCITT. See Annex A for example implementation and
test vectors.

# Stack Service Specification

specification includes description of usage, primitives, and frame formats of
the services. Table 3 list all the primitives and their primitive IDs.

For clarity, the figures of the frames presented in this section also include
the general frame fields (Primitive ID, Frame ID, Payload length, and CRC), but
their descriptions are omitted as they are already explained in section [General
Frame
Format](#General-Frame-Format).

## Node Addressing

The Wirepas Mesh Dual-MCU API services use a 32-bit address to indicate sources
and destinations of packets.
Two special addresses have been reserved. First, address 0x0000 0000 (zero) or
0xFFFFFFFE (4 294 967 294) is used as the *anySink* address which identifies
that the source or the destination of a packet is an unspecified sink on the
network. The highest address 0xFFFF FFFF is used as the *broadcast* address. It
is used to transmit a downlink packet to all nodes on the network from a sink.
Nodes are not allowed to use these two special addresses as their own address.
Similarly, addresses in multicast address space cannot be used as own address.
The addresses are summarized in Table 4.


*Table 4. Addressing summary*

| **Address type** | **Valid address space** | **Description** |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Unicast          | 0x00000001-  0x7FFFFFFF  (1 – 2 147 483 647)  and  0x81000000-  0xFFFFFFFD  (2 164 260 864 – 4 294 967 293) | Valid unicast addresses. Each node on the network must have one of these addresses set as its address. Two or more devices with identical addresses should never be present on a network.
| Broadcast        | 0xFFFF FFFF  (4 294 967 295) | Broadcast address with which a packet is delivered to all nodes on the network
| AnySink          | 0xFFFFFFFE  (4 294 967 294)  or 0x00000000 (0)  | Address which identifies that the source or the destination of a packet is an unspecified sink on the network  With current tree routing, only nodes may use this as the destination address when sending packets. These addresses are reserved as Wirepas reserved addresses and cannot be used as addresses for any nodes in the network.
| Multicast        | 0x80000000-  0x80FFFFFF  (2 147 483 648 –  2 164 260 863) | Packet is delivered to the group of nodes. Group may contain 0 or more nodes. Each node may belong to 0 or more groups. The lowest 24 bits contain the actual group address and highest bit is an indication that message is sent to that group.

## Data Services (DSAP)

The data services are used to transmit/receive application data via the network.

### DSAP-DATA_TX Service

The DSAP-DATA_TX service is used to transport APDUs from the application to the
stack. The stack transmits the APDUs to other node(s) on the network, according
to set parameters. The DSAP-DATA_TX service includes the following primitives:

-   DSAP-DATA_TX.request

-   DSAP-DATA_TX.confirm

-   DSAP-DATA_TX_TT.request

-   DSAP-DATA_TX_TT.confirm

-   DSAP-DATA_TX_FRAG.request

-   DSAP-DATA_TX_FRAG.confirm

-   DSAP-DATA_TX.indication

-   DSAP-DATA_TX.response (All response primitives have the same format, see
    section [Response
    Primitives](#Response-Primitives))

#### DSAP-DATA_TX.request

The DSAP-DATA_TX.request is issued by the application when it wants to send
data. Frame fields are described in the table below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**                              |
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| *Primitive ID* | 1        | 0x01             | Identifier of DSAP-DATA_TX.request primitive |
| *Frame ID*     | 1        | 0 – 255          | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *PDUID*        | 2        | 0 – 65534        | PDU identifier decided by the application  The PDU ID can be used to keep track of APDUs processed by the stack as the same PDU ID is contained in a corresponding DSAP-DATA_TX.indication sent by the stack to the application. E.g. the application can keep the PDU in its own buffers until the successful transmission is indicated by the stack in DSAP-DATA_TX.indication.  PDU ID 65535 (0xFFFF) is reserved and should not be used.  Also see Note 1.
| *SourceEndpoint* | 1      | 0 – 239          | Source endpoint number  Also see Note 2.
| *DestinationAddress*  | 4 | 0 – 4294967295   | Destination node address  Also see Note 3.
| *DestinationEndpoint* | 1 | 0 – 239          | Destination endpoint number  Also see Note 2.
| *QoS*          | 1        | 0 or 1           | Quality of service class to be used. The different values are defined as follows:<p> - 0 = Use traffic class 0, i.e. normal priority<p> - 1 = Use traffic class 1, i.e. high priority.
| *TXOptions*    | 1        | 00xx xxxx  (bitfield, where x can be 0 or 1) | The TX options are indicated as a bit field with individual bits defined as follows:<p> - Bit 0 = 0: Do not generate DSAP-DATA_TX.indication<p> - Bit 0 = 1: Generate DSAP-DATA_TX.indication  Bit 0 is used to register for receiving a DSAP-DATA_TX.indication after the PDU has been successfully transmitted to next hop node or cleared from the PDU buffers due to timeout or congestion. Also see Note 1.<p> - Bit 1 = 1, Use unacknowledged CSMA-CA transmission method<p> - Bit 1 = 0, Use normal transmission method.  See Note 4.<p> - Bits 2-5: Hop limit. Maximum number of hops executed for packet to reach the destination. See Note 5.<p> - Bits 6-7: Reserved <p>Here, bit 0 is the least significant bit and bit 7 is the most significant bit.
| *APDULength*    | 1        | 1 – 102 | The length of the following APDU in octets
| *APDU*          | 1 – 102  | \-      | Application payload
| *CRC*           | 2        | \-      | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

**Note 1:** These fields are used only locally for the communication between the
application layer and the stack. They are not actually transmitted on the
network. Only 16 requests where generation of DSAP-DATA_TX.indication is active
are allowed at the same time. Without generation of the indication, there is
room for plenty of more requests simultaneously.


**Note 2:** The endpoint numbers are used to distinguish different application
channels. E.g. if the device has multiple sensors it could use different
endpoint numbers for APDUs containing data from different sensors or different
endpoint numbers for applications with different functionality.
Endpoints 240 – 255 are reserved for Wirepas Mesh stack internal use.
Note 3:Note that a broadcast will only be transmitted (downlink) to the nodes
directly under the sink's routing tree. To reach all nodes on the network, it is
necessary to send the broadcast from all sinks. All devices can send traffic to
themselves (loopback) by using their own address as destination.


**Note 4:** The unacknowledged CSMA-CA transmission method can be used in a
mixed network (i.e. network consisting of both CSMA-CA and TDMA devices) by
CSMA-CA device originated packets transmission only to CSMA-CA devices. The
purpose of this method is to avoid a performance bottleneck by NOT transmitting
to TDMA devices. Also, if used with sink-originated transmissions (by CSMA-CA
mode sinks), the throughput is better when compared to a 'normal' transmission,
however there is some penalty in reliability (due to unacknowledged nature of
transmission).


**Note 5:** Hop limit sets the upper value to the number of hops executed for
packet to reach the destination. By using hop limiting, it is possible to limit
the distance how far the packet is transmitted to and avoiding causing
unnecessary traffic to network. Hop count value of 0 is used to disable the hop
limiting. Hop limiting value does **not** have any impact when using *AnySink*
address as destination node address but is discarded.

## Management Services (MSAP)

The management services are used to control the stack at run-time, as well as
read and write run-time parameters of the stack.

### INDICATION_POLL Service

For enabling variety of application architectures, the application may poll the
stack indications when it is most convenient. This is enabled by the indication
IRQ with MSAP-INDICATION_POLL service. The MSAP-INDICATION_POLL service includes
the following primitives:

-   MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.request

-   MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.confirm

The MSAP-INDICATION_POLL service is used to query indications from the stack.
This mechanism is used for all indications independent of the service.
The basic flow for receiving indications from the stack goes as follows:

1.  The stack asserts the IRQ signal to indicate that it has pending
    indication(s) that it wants to deliver to the application. For
    hardware-specific information on the IRQ signal, see the appropriate
    hardware reference manual.

2.  The application sends MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.request to query for the
    indication(s).

3.  The stack responds with MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.confirm to indicate that it
    will start sending pending indications.

4.  The stack sends a pending indication. The individual indication format
    depends on the service that has issued the indication and follows the
    indication formats specified in this document.

5.  The application sends a response to acknowledge the indication. In the
    response, the application also indicates if it wants to receive another
    pending indication.

6.  If the response frame indicated that the application wants to receive
    another indication and there are still pending indications: Go to step 4.

The indication exchange stops if a) there are no more pending indications (in
which case the stack de-asserts the IRQ), or b) the application indicates in a
response that it does not want to receive more indications at the moment (in
which case pending indications, if there are any, can be queried later).
Note:If there are no pending indications when the application issues a
MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.request (i.e. the request is issued, but IRQ signal is not
asserted), the stack replies only with MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.confirm and informs
that there are no pending indications at the moment.

#### MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.request

The MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.request is issued by the application layer when it
wants to query stack indications.
The MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.request frame does not contain any payload.

#### MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.confirm

The MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.confirm is issued by the stack as a response to the
MSAP-INDICATION_POLL.request. Frame fields are described in the table below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**

### MSAP-STACK_STOP Service

The stack can be stopped using the MSAP-STACK_STOP service. The MSAP-STACK_STOP
service includes the following primitives:

-   MSAP-STACK_STOP.request

-   MSAP-STACK_STOP.confirm

#### MSAP-STACK_STOP.request

The MSAP-STACK_STOP.request is issued by the application layer when the stack
needs to be stopped. Stopping the stack will cause the firmware to reboot. This
has the following side effects:

-   All buffered data will be lost, including data being routed from other nodes

-   If there is a new OTAP scratchpad that has been marked to be processed, the
    bootloader will process it, e.g. update the stack firmware (see section
    [MSAP-SCRATCHPAD Services](#MSAP-SCRATCHPAD-Services))

Note:A successful MSAP-STACK_STOP.request sets the MSAP auto-start attribute to
disabled. For more information on the auto-start feature, see section
[mAutostart](#mAutostart).

The MSAP-STACK_STOP.request frame does not contain any payload.

#### MSAP-STACK_STOP.confirm

The MSAP-STACK_STOP.confirm issued by the stack as a response to the
MSAP-STACK_STOP.request. Frame fields are described in the table below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------
| *Primitive ID* | 1        | 0x06             | Identifier of MSAP-STACK_STOP.confirm primitive
| *Frame ID*     | 1        | 0 – 255          | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *Result*       | 1        | 0, 1 or 128      | The return result of the corresponding MSAP-STACK_STOP.request. The different values are defined as follows:<p> - 0 = Success: Stack stopped<p> - 1 = Failure: Stack already stopped<p> - 128 = Failure: Access denied (see section [cFeatureLockBits](#cFeatureLockBits))
| *CRC*          | 2        | \-               | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

**Note:** After device has sent the MSAP-STACK_STOP.confirm message, device is
rebooted. This takes a while. During the rebooting, the device does not respond
to messages. One example of how to detect when the rebooting has been done is to
issue read-only commands to the device and when it responses to such, the
rebooting has been performed. For example, use MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ command (see
section [MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ Service](#MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ-Service))
to query attribute
[mStackStatus](#mStackStatus).

### MSAP-STACK_STATE Service

The MSAP-STACK_STATE service informs the stack state at boot. MSAP-STACK_STATE
service includes the following primitives:

-   MSAP-STACK_STATE.indication

-   MSAP-STACK_STATE.response (All response primitives have the same format, see
    section [Response Primitives](#Response-Primitives))

#### MSAP-STACK_STATE.indication

The MSAP-STACK_STATE.indication is issued by the stack when it has booted. Frame
fields are described in the table below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------
| *Primitive ID* | 1        | 0x07             | Identifier of MSAP-STACK_STATE.indication primitive
| *Frame ID*     | 1        | 0 – 255          | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *IndicationStatus* | 1    | 0 or 1           | 0 = No other indications queued1 = More indications queued
| *Status*           | 1    | 0xxx xxxx  (where x can be 0 or 1) | The stack status is indicated as a bit field with individual bits defined as follows:  <p> - Bit 0 = 0: Stack running, see Note below<p> - Bit 0 = 1: Stack stopped<p> - Bit 1 = 0: Network address set<p> - Bit 1 = 1: Network address missing<p> - Bit 2 = 0: Node address set<p> - Bit 2 = 1: Node address missing<p> - Bit 3 = 0: Network channel set<p> - Bit 3 = 1: Network channel missing<p> - Bit 4 = 0: Role set<p> - Bit 4 = 1: Role missing<p> - Bit 5 = 0: Application configuration data valid<p> - Bit 5 = 1: Application configuration data missing (valid only on sink device)<p> - Bit 7: Reserved  <p>where bit 0 is the least significant bit and bit 7 is the most significant bit.
| *CRC*              | 2        | \-           | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

**Note:** If the stack sends an MSAP-STACK_STATE.indication where the status bit
0 = 0, it means that the stack has auto-started. If the status bit 0 = 1, it
means that auto-start is disabled. For more information on the auto-start
feature, see section [mAutostart](#mAutostart).

### MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE Service

The MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE service can be used for two things:

1.  Configure application-specific parameters (application configuration data)
    to the application running in the nodes (via the network)

2.  Configure transmission interval of the stack diagnostic data

The application configuration data is persistent global data for the whole
network. The data format can be decided by the application. Application
configuration data can be set by the sinks' application after which it is
disseminated to the whole network and stored at every node. It can include e.g.
application parameters, such as measurement interval. The service makes it
possible to set the data, after which every new node joining the network
receives the data from its neighbors without the need for end-to-end polling.
Furthermore, new configurations can be set and updated to the network on the
run.
The MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE service includes the following primitives:

-   MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.request

-   MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.confirm

**Note 1:**The MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE service can only be used in sink role.
**Note 2:** In a network including multiple sinks, the same configuration data
should be set to all sinks so that it can be guaranteed to disseminate to every
node.
**Note 3:**Application configuration data is stored in permanent memory
similarly to the persistent attributes. To avoid memory wearing, do not write
new values too often (e.g. more often than once per 30 minutes).

#### MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.request

The MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.request is issued by the application when it
wants to set or change the network configuration data contents. Frame fields are
described in the table below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------
| *Primitive ID* | 1        | 0x3A             | Identifier of MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.request primitive
| *Frame ID*     | 1        | 0 – 255          | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *SequenceNumber* | 1      | NA   | Sequence number is not needed anymore from this API, and is managed automatically by the stack in order to propagate correctly the new information set. This value is just ignored and can be anything.
| *DiagnosticDataInterval* | 2  | 0, 30, 60, 120, 300, 600, 1800, default value is 0 | Diagnostic data transmission interval in seconds, i.e. how often the nodes on the network should send diagnostic PDUs.  If the value is 0, diagnostic data transmission is disabled.
| *AppConfigData* | X  | Raw hex data, default value is filled with 0x00    | Application configuration data. The format can be decided by the application.  Size of the field is defined by CSAP attribute cAppConfigDataSize (see section [cAppConfigDataSize](#cAppConfigDataSize))
| *CRC*           | 2  | \-                                                 | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

**Note:** It is recommended that the configuration data is not written too
often, as new configuration data is always written to the non-volatile memory of
the sink and disseminated to the network. This can cause unnecessary wearing of
the memory with devices that need to use the program memory to store persistent
variables and unnecessary load to the network.

#### MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.confirm

The MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.confirm is issued by the stack in response to the
MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.request. Frame fields are described in the table
below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------
| *Primitive ID* | 1        | 0xBA             | Identifier of MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.confirm primitive
| *Frame ID*     | 1        | 0 – 255          | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *Result*       | 1        | 0 – 4            | The return result of the corresponding MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE.request. The different values are defined as follows: <p> - 0 = Success: New configuration written to sink's non-volatile memory and scheduled for transmission <p> - 1 = Failure: The node is not a sink  <p> - 2 = Failure: Invalid DiagnosticDataInterval value  <p> - 4 = Failure: Access denied (see section [cFeatureLockBits](#cFeatureLockBits))
| *CRC*          | 2        | \-               | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

### MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_READ Service

application configuration data. The MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_READ service includes
the following primitives:

-   MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_READ.request

-   MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_READ.confirm

For sinks, the service returns the configuration data last written to the stack
using the MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE service. For nodes, the service returns the
configuration data that was last received from neighboring nodes.

#### MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_READ.request

The MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_READ.request is issued by the application when it wants
to read the network configuration data contents.

| *Result*                 | 1        | 0 – 2                          | Return result for the corresponding MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_READ.request. The different values are defined as follows:<p> - 0 = Success: Configuration received/set<p> - 1 = Failure: No configuration received/set<p> - 2 = Failure: Access denied (see section [cFeatureLockBits](#cFeatureLockBits))  <p>When used with nodes, indicates whether configuration has been received from neighbors. When used with sinks, indicates whether configuration has already been set (by using MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE service).
| *SequenceNumber*         | 1        | 0 – 254                        | Sequence number for filtering old and already received application configuration data packets at the nodes. This parameter can be used by the application to decide if the configuration data has been updated. See section [Sequence Numbers](#Sequence-Numbers) for details.  The returned value is never 255.
| *DiagnosticDataInterval* | 2        | 0, 30, 60, 120, 300, 600, 1800 | Diagnostic data transmission interval in seconds, i.e. how often the stack should send diagnostic PDUs  <p>If the value is 0, diagnostic data transmission is disabled.
| *AppConfigData*          | X        | \-                             | Application configuration data. The format can be decided by the application.  Size of the field is defined by CSAP attribute cAppConfigDataSize (see section [cAppConfigDataSize](#cAppConfigDataSize))
| *CRC*                    | 2        | \-                             | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

### MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_RX Service

### MSAP-SCRATCHPAD Services

Wirepas Mesh stack support a feature called Over-The-Air-Programming (OTAP).
Nodes reserve any unused non-volatile memory as storage for large bulk data.
This area is called the OTAP scratchpad. OTAP scratchpad can be used to
distribute new firmware, applications and other large pieces of data to all
nodes on the network. Nodes keep track of the scratchpad sequence numbers of
their neighbors, and coordinate the distribution of the most recent OTAP
scratchpad to all nodes.
Any node can be used to introduce a new OTAP scratchpad to the network, but the
stack must be in the stopped state while writing the scratchpad data. After the
stack is started, the OTAP transfer will begin (unless disabled for this node).
Note: It is recommended that the scratchpad data is not rewritten too often, as
new data is always written to the non-volatile memory of the sink and
distributed to all nodes on the network. This can cause unnecessary wearing of
the non-volatile memory and unnecessary load to the network.

#### MSAP-SCRATCHPAD_START.request

The MSAP-SCRATCHPAD_START.request is issued by the application when it wants to
clear and rewrite the Scratchpad contents of this node. Any previous scratchpad
contents are erased.

### MSAP-NON-ROUTER LONG SLEEP (NRLS) Service

The Non-Router Long Sleep (NRLS) is a service used to sleep Wirepas Mesh stack
for time periods. Once waking-up from the sleep, Wirepas Mesh stack wakes up
from the sleep without system reset. During Wirepas Mesh stack sleep the NRLS
services over Dual-MCU API are available. Before entering to NRLS sleep, Wirepas
Mesh stack needs to be running.
In order to use NRLS servicethe cNodeRole (as defined in Table 51) needs to be
configured to stack as 0x03 (non router node). Any other node role settings do
not allow to use NRLS functionality..
The MSAP-NON-ROUTER LONG SLEEP service includes following primitives:

-   MSAP-NRLS.request

-   MSAP-NRLS.confirm

-   MSAP-NRLS_STOP.request

-   MSAP-NRLS_STOP.confirm

-   MSAP-NRLS_STATE_GET.request

-   MSAP-NRLS_STATE_GET.response

-   MSAP-NRLS_GOTOSLEEP_INFO.request

-   MSAP-NRLS_GOTOSLEEP_INFO.response

#### MSAP-NRLS.request

This command shall start the Wirepas Mesh stack sleep for defined time. Frame
fields are described in the table below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------
| *Primitive ID*        | 1        | 0x40             | Identifier of MSAP-NRLS.request primitive
| *Frame ID*            | 1        | 0 – 255          | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *NRLS time*           | 4        | 0 to 0x93A80     | 0 = Starts Wirepas Mesh stack sleep for maximum value of 0x93A80 seconds (7 days)  Other values = sleep time in seconds
| *Appconfig wait time* | 4        | 0x04 to 0x258    | 0 = App config is not awaited before going to sleep  Other values = Time used to wait for app config data is received from network before going to sleep
| *CRC*                 | 2        | \-               | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

Wirepas Mesh stack sleep time is expressed in seconds. Sleep time starts when
node gets disconnected from Mesh network. To disconnect from the network, some
time is needed for signaling before disconnection is completed (the NRLS time
does not include this time needed for signaling before going to sleep).
Signaling before actual stack sleep start might take time up to 30 seconds or
more depending of used radio.
If the time when waking up from NRLS sleep and going back to NRLS sleep is very
short and app config is used to signal to the network e.g. overhaul state, good
practice is to have Appconfig wait time long enough (minimum 4 seconds) to make
sure that app config data is received before going to NRLS sleep (see more
information in
[[1]](#References)).

### MSAP-MAX_MESSAGE_QUEUING Service

The maximum message queuing services are used to change or read the current
value of the time for how long the message is hold in the node's queue before it
is discarded. Queuing time can be changed to normal and high priority messages.
Select queuing time carefully, too short value might cause unnecessary message
drops and too big value filling up message queues. For consistent performance it
is recommended to use the same queuing time in the whole network.
Minimum queuing time shall be bigger than access cycle interval in TDMA
networks. It is recommended to use multiples of access cycle interval (+ extra)
to give time for message repetitions, higher priority messages taking over the
access slot etc. Access cycle is not limiting the minimum value in CSMA-CA
networks.
Precision of the time when message is discarded depends on the checking interval
of message's age. Interval is 1s in CSMA-CA and 15s for energy saving reasons in
TDMA networks i.e. precision is 1s or 15s depending on used channel access
method.
The MSAP-MAX_MESSAGE_QUEUING service includes following primitives:

-   MSAP-MAX_QUEUE_TIME_WRITE.request

#### mStackStatus

| **Attribute ID** | **1**               |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Type             | Read only           |
| Size             | 1 octet             |
| Valid values     | 0x00 – 0x3f or 0x80 |
| Default value    | \-                  |

The Stack status attribute indicates whether the stack is running or not, and
whether it can be started. The stack status is a bit field with individual bits
defined in Table 46.


*Table 46. Stack status bits*

| **Bit number** | **Description**                                                                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 (LSB)        | 0: Stack running1: Stack stopped                                                                             |

| 7 (MSB)        | Reserved                                                                                                     |

#### mPDUBufferUsage

| **Attribute ID** | **2**                |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Type             | Read only            |
| Size             | 1 octet              |
| Valid values     | 0 – *cPDUBufferSize* |
| Default value    | \-                   |

The PDUs processed by the stack are stored in a buffer. There is a maximum limit
for the number of PDUs that can fit in the buffer (see CSAP *cPDUBufferSize*
attribute in section
[cPDUBufferSize](#cPDUBufferSize)).
The *mPDUBufferUsage* attribute tells how many PDU items there are in the buffer
at the moment.

#### mPDUBufferCapacity

| **Attribute ID** | **3**                |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Type             | Read only            |
| Size             | 1 octet              |
| Valid values     | 0 – *cPDUBufferSize* |
| Default value    | \-                   |

The *mPDUBufferCapacity* attribute indicates the number of PDUs that can still
fit in the stack PDU buffer at the moment (i.e. *cPDUBufferSize -
mPDUBufferUsage*).

#### mAutostart

| **Attribute ID** | **6**          |
|------------------|----------------|
| Type             | Read and write |
| Size             | 1 octet        |
| Valid values     | 0 or 1         |
| Default value    | 1              |

The stack auto-start function starts the stack automatically after boot (e.g.
when returning from power down or when the stack is internally booted). A value
of 1 enables auto-start, 0 disables it.

#### mRouteCount

| **Attribute ID** | **7**     |
|------------------|-----------|
| Type             | Read only |
| Size             | 1 octet   |
| Valid values     | 0 or 1    |
| Default value    | \-        |

Whenever there is a route to sink, the *mRouteCount* attribute is 1, otherwise
0.

#### mSystemTime

| Attribute ID  | 8               |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Type          | Read only       |
| Size          | 4 octets        |
| Valid values  | 0 to 4294967295 |
| Default value | \-              |

The stack keeps track of time in 1/128 s increments. Attribute *mSystemTime* can
be used to read the amount of time elapsed from the stack startup. *mSystemTime*
wraps back to 0 about every 388 days.

#### mAccessCycleRange

| Attribute ID  | 9                     |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Type          | Read and write        |
| Size          | 4 octets              |
| Valid values  | See description below |
| Default value | Not set               |

Normally the stack chooses a suitable access cycle automatically, between 2, 4
or 8 seconds, depending on the amount of network traffic. Some applications may
need to further limit the access cycle durations in use. Attribute
*mAccessCycleRange* can be used to do that.
Two 16-bit values are packed in one 32-bit attribute: top 16 bits contain the
maximum access cycle duration, bottom 16 bits contain the minimum access cycle
duration. Access cycle durations are expressed in milliseconds, so valid values
for minimum and maximum are 2000, 4000 and 8000.
If *mAccessCycleRange* is not set, or maximum \> minimum, the stack chooses an
appropriate access cycle based on the amount of network traffic. If maximum =
minimum, the user can force the access cycle to a specific duration.
*mAccessCycleRange* is not set by default. Only a factory reset (see section
[CSAP-FACTORY_RESET
Service](#CSAP-FACTORY_RESET-Service))
can restore *mAccessCycleRange* back to the unset state.
Note: When CSMA-CA mode is set as device role (see chapter
[cNodeRole](#cNodeRole)),
setting *mAccessCycleRange* cannot be done

#### mAccessCycleLimits

| Attribute ID  | 10                    |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Type          | Read only             |
| Size          | 4 octets              |
| Valid values  | See description below |
| Default value | 0x1f4007d0            |

The *mAccessCycleLimits* attribute can be read to determine the valid values for
*mAccessCycleRange* (see section
[mAccessCycleRange](#mAccessCycleRange)).
Similarly to *mAccessCycleRange*, two 16-bit values are packed in one 32-bit
attribute: top 16 bits contain the maximum valid access cycle duration, bottom
16 bits contain the minimum valid access cycle duration.
In current Wirepas Mesh firmware release, the value of *mAccessCycleLimits* is
(8000 \<\< 16) + 2000, or 0x1f4007d0, i.e. the minimum valid access cycle
duration is 2000 ms and the maximum valid access cycle duration is 8000 ms.
(4000 ms is also a valid access cycle duration, but that possibility is not
encoded in the value of *mAccessCycleLimits*.)

#### mCurrentAccessCycle

| **Attribute ID** | **11**           |
|------------------|------------------|
| Type             | Read only        |
| Size             | 2 octets         |
| Valid values     | 2000, 4000, 8000 |
| Default value    | \-               |

The *mCurrentAccessCycle* attribute reports the currently used access cycle, in
milliseconds.

#### mScratchpadBlockMax

| **Attribute ID** | **12**    |
|------------------|-----------|
| Type             | Read only |
| Size             | 1 octet   |
| Valid values     | \-        |
| Default value    | \-        |

The attribute *mScratchpadBlockMax* contains the value for maximum number of
bytes in an MSAP-SCRATCHPAD_BLOCK request (see section
[MSAP-SCRATCHPAD_BLOCK.request](#MSAP-SCRATCHPAD_BLOCK.request)).

#### mMulticastGroups

| Attribute ID  | 13                    |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Type          | Read and Write        |
| Size          | 10 \* 4 octets        |
| Valid values  | See description below |
| Default value | 10 x 0xFFFFFFFF       |

The attribute *mMulticastGroups* tells in which multicast groups the device
belongs to. When data packet is sent with multicast group address (see chapter
2.1), only nodes belonging to that group will receive it. Each group is 4 octets
long with following value ranges:

-   0: Don't care value

-   1-0x00FF FFFF: Belonging to multicast groups 0x8000 0001-0x80FF FFFF

-   Other values reserved for future use

**Note:** Chapter 2.1 defines the multicast addresses to be in range between
0x80000000-0x80FFFFFF, MSB byte (0x80) is not used in this attribute. As well,
it is not possible to declare membership to group 0x80000000 (since 3 LSB bytes
would be 0).
The value of the attribute is the collection of 10 groups. All values **must**
be given. If device belongs to less than 10 groups, use value 0 of don't care
value. Devices don't have to belong to any groups (which is default value).
Don't care values can reside at the middle of the sequence. Same value can
present multiple times in the sequence. Addresses can reside in the sequence in
any order.
When data is transmitted to the multicast groups, all the nodes that belong to
that group receive the message. Few examples:

#### mScratchpadNumBytes

| **Attribute ID** | **14**    |
|------------------|-----------|
| Type             | Read only |
| Size             | 4 octets  |
| Valid values     | \-        |
| Default value    | \-        |

The attribute *mScratchpadNumBytes* contains the size of the currently stored scratchpad in bytes. It is the same value as the *ScratchpadLengthInBytes* field in [MSAP-SCRATCHPAD_STATUS.confirm](#MSAP-SCRATCHPAD_STATUS.confirm).

## Configuration Services (CSAP)

The configuration services are used to control the stack configuration.

### CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE Service

The CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE service can be used by the application layer to write
the configuration attributes to the stack. The CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE service
includes the following primitives:

-   CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE.request

-   CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE.confirm

The CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE service primitives' frame formats are identical with
the MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE service (See section [MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE
Service](#MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_WRITE-Service)).
Only differences are used primitive IDs and valid attributes that can be
read/written. For valid CSAP attributes see section [CSAP
Attributes](#CSAP-Attributes).
Note: The configuration attributes can only be written when the stack is in
stopped state.

### CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ Service

The CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ service can be used by the application layer to read the
configuration attributes from the stack. The CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ service
includes the following primitives:

-   CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ.request

-   CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ.confirm

The CSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ service primitives' frame formats are identical with the
MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ service (See section [MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ
Service](#MSAP-ATTRIBUTE_READ-Service)).
Only differences are used primitive IDs and valid attributes that can be
read/written. For valid CSAP attributes see section [CSAP
Attributes](#CSAP-Attributes).

### CSAP-FACTORY_RESET Service

The persistent attributes can be cleared using the CSAP-FACTORY_RESET service.
The CSAP-FACTORY_RESET service includes the following primitives:

-   CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.request

-   CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.confirm

#### CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.request

The CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.request issued by the application layer when the
persistent attributes should be cleared. Frame fields are described in the table
below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------
| *Primitive ID* | 1        | 0x16                                  | Identifier of CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.request primitive
| *Frame ID*     | 1        | 0 – 255                               | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *ResetKey*     | 4        | 0x74 0x49 0x6F 0x44 (“DoIt” in ASCII) | Special key value used to verify that user wants to clear persistent values
| *CRC*          | 2        | \-                                    | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

#### CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.confirm

The CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.confirm issued by the stack as a response to the
CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.request. Frame fields are described in the table below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------
| *Primitive ID* | 1        | 0x96             | Identifier of CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.confirm primitive
| *Frame ID*     | 1        | 0 – 255          | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *Result*       | 1        | 0 – 2            | The return result of the corresponding CSAP-FACTORY_RESET.request. The different values are defined as follows:<p> - 0 = Success<p> - 1 = Failure: Stack in invalid state to clear attributes<p> - 2 = Failure: Attempted to use an invalid reset key<p> - 3 = Failure: Access denied (see section [cFeatureLockBits](#cFeatureLockBits))
| *CRC*          | 2        | \-               | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

### CSAP Attributes

The CSAP attributes are specified in Table 50.

| Size             | 4 octets                    |
| Valid values     | Any valid *unicast* address |
| Default value    | Not set                     |

Attribute *cNodeAddress* sets the address of the node. See section [Node
Addressing](#Node-Addressing)
for details.

#### cNetworkAddress

| **Attribute ID** | **2**               |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Type             | Read and write      |
| Size             | 3 octets            |
| Valid values     | 0x000001 – 0xFFFFFE |
| Default value    | Not set             |

*cNetworkAddress*, the network address, is used by the radio to detect valid
transmissions and to filter out both noise and other transmissions which do not
belong to the same network. The network address must be identical for all nodes
within the same network. Multiple Wirepas Mesh networks can coexist within an
area, if they are configured to use different network addresses.
Due to the way radios detect valid transmissions, some network addresses are
better than others. A good network address should have no repetition or
patterns. Examples of poor network addresses: 0x000000, 0xFFFFFF, 0xAAAAAA,
0x555555. When choosing a network address for a network, using a 24-bit random
number as the network address is recommended.

#### cNetworkChannel

Each network has a default channel, set by the *cNetworkChannel* attribute. The
network channel must be identical for all nodes within the same network.
Available radio channel range depends on the radio hardware and frequency band
of operation. See attribute *cChannelLimits* in section
[cChannelLimits](#cChannelLimits).
The network channel is used for finding neighbors in a situation where no
neighbors are yet known, e.g. right after the stack has started.

| Valid values     | 0x00 – 0xFFFFFFFE |
| Default value    | 0x11111111        |

Attribute cChannelAllocMap can be used to dedicate radio channels for devices
that have CB-MAC role definition enabled or devices that do not .
Each bit in the value represents one radio channel. LSB equals the first
available channel. If bit is set, the radio channel is dedicated for devices
that are configured to CB-MAC mode. If bit is not set, the radio channel is
dedicated for devices that are not configured to CB-MAC mode. The default value
equals 25% of channels to be dedicated for devices configured to CB-MAC mode.
This attribute is mainly important in dense networks and by using this
attribute, the amount of devices within radio range can be maximized. For
example: if none of the devices are configured to CB-MAC mode, it is recommended
to set this value as 0.
**Note: This attribute must be the same throughout the network to operate
correctly!**
**Note: WM FW v3.6.0, v3.6.6, v3.6.7, v3.5.32, v3.5.36 releases and v4.0.xx
release onwards cChannelAllocMap attribute does not exists anymore - writing

Certain stack features can be disabled by using the *cFeatureLockBits* and
*cFeatureLockKey* (see section
[cFeatureLockKey](#cFeatureLockKey))
attributes. Supported feature lock bits are listed in Table 54
A feature can be disabled by clearing its feature lock bit to zero. By default,
no features are disabled, i.e. the feature lock bits are all set. Reserved bits
cannot be set to zero. Feature lock is only in effect when a feature lock key is
set.

#### cFeatureLockKey

| **Attribute ID** | **23**              |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Type             | Write only          |
| Size             | 16 octets           |
| Valid values     | 0x00..00 – 0xFF..FF |
| Default value    | 0xFF..FF            |

Attribute *cFeatureLockKey* sets the key that is used for enabling the feature
lock. A value of 0xFF..FF means that the key is not set. Feature lock bits (see
section
[cFeatureLockBits](#cFeatureLockBits))
are only in effect when a key is set.
When a feature lock key is set, it can only be cleared by writing
*cFeatureLockKey* with the correct key. This clears the key, i.e. sets a key
value with all bits set (0xFF..FF).
It is not possible to read the feature lock key back. However, it is possible to
detect whether a key is set or not. When reading the key value, the error value
4 (Failure: Invalid attribute value or attribute value not yet set) indicates
that key is not set. And error value of 5 (Failure: Write-only attribute)
indicates that the key has been set.

# Response Primitives

All stack indications must be acknowledged by the application using a response-primitive. All the
response-primitives have the same frame format as illustrated in table below. Only thing that
changes is the Primitive ID. The values of the primitive IDs are listed in [Table 3](#stack-service-specification).


| **Primitive ID** | **Frame ID** | **Payload length** | **Result**   | **CRC**  |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 octet          | 1 octet      | 1 octet            | 1 octet      | 2 octets |

Frame fields are described in the table below.

| **Field Name** | **Size** | **Valid Values** | **Description**
|----------------|----------|------------------|----------------
| *Primitive ID* | 1        | -                | Response Id associated to Indication Id as descibed in [Table 3](#stack-service-specification)
| *Frame ID*     | 1        | 0 – 255          | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)
| *Result*       | 1        | 0 - 1            | The result field indicates if the application is ready to receive another pending indication (if there are any)<p>The different values are defined as follows: <p> - 0 = Do not send more indications<p> - 1 = Send next pending indication
| *CRC*          | 2        | \-               | See section [General Frame Format](#General-Frame-Format)

# Sequence Numbers

Some Wirepas Mesh stack services, such as the application configuration data
service (sections [MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE
Service](#MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE-Service)-[MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_RX
Service](#MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_RX-Service))
make use of 8-bit sequence numbers. When new data is entered on the network, the
sequence number needs to be incremented, so that nodes can differentiate between
old and new data.
Due to the limited numeric range of an 8-bit sequence number, the following
wrap-around rule is utilized:

-   A is larger than B if (A - B) AND 128 is 0, unless A equals B

For example, values 0 to 127 are considered to be larger than 255, but values
128 to 254 are considered smaller than 255. Likewise, values 1 to 128 are seen
as greater than 0, but values 129 to 255 are seen as less than 0.

# Common Use Cases

This section describes various problem cases with Wirepas Mesh Dual-MCU API as
well as guidance on various issues for the user.

## Required Configuration

Each node requires some configuration in order the Wirepas Mesh stack to operate
and establish communication. The required services to be configured are
explained in Table 72.


*Table 72. Required node configuration*

| **Service** | **See section** | **Description**
|-------------|-----------------|------------------

| *CSAP_ATTRIBUTE_WRITE / cNodeRole* (optional)          | [cNodeRole](#cNodeRole)                                                   | Role of a device must be set. Node can be a sink, a headnode capable of routing or a non-routing subnode.                                         |
| *CSAP_ATTRIBUTE_WRITE / cCipherKey* (optional)         | [cCipherKey](#cCipherKey)                                                 | If encryption of network traffic is desired, a cipher key must be set. Without cipher or authentication keys the encryption is disabled.          |
| *CSAP_ATTRIBUTE_WRITE / cAuthenticationKey* (optional) | [cAuthenticationKey](#cAuthenticationKey)                                 | If encryption of network traffic is desired, an authentication key must be set. Without cipher or authentication keys the encryption is disabled. |
| *MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE (optional)*                | [MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE Service](#MSAP-APP_CONFIG_DATA_WRITE-Service) | Note: This applies only for sinks! Headnodes or subnodes get their configuration data from the network and cannot have it set directly.           |
| *MSAP_STACK_START*                                     | [MSAP-STACK_START Service](#MSAP-STACK_START-Service)                     | Apply settings and begin communicating with other nodes on the network.                                                                           |
