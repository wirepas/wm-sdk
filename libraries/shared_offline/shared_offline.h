/**

 *
 * This library allows multiple application modules to control the NRLS feature
 * of the stack at the same time without conflicts.
 * Ie, when the stack can freely disconnect from the network and enter offline
 * mode.
 * The purpose of this mode is to save energy.
 *
 * @note    Switching too often between online and offline mode may have the
 *          opposite desired effect. In fact, each time a node will be back
 *          in online mode, it will trigger a scan and consume additional power.
 * @note    This library can only be used if node role is non-router. Otherwise
 *          it will have no effect.

 *          directly from this callback.
 * \note    For power consumption optimization, each module should try
 *          (if possible) to move forward their network activity
 *          (like sending a status) if their deadline is close,
 *          instead of asking to go offline for very short period.

 *          called earlier if someone else has requested the online state
