# Application folder

Multiple applications are provided in the SDK. They are classified in
different folders depending on their purpose.

## [Reference apps](reference_apps/Readme.md)

These applications are reference application which are heavily tested by Wirepas.
They can be a strong foundation to be used in a product with minimal adaptation.

## [Example apps](example_apps/Readme.md)

These applications demonstrate a feature or a use case example.
They are more complete application examples but require most of the time modifications.

## [Unitary apps](./unitary_apps/Readme.md)

These applications demonstrate a single feature or a Wirepas library. They are not
full application and are not doing anything useful except demonstrating the
usage of a feature.
