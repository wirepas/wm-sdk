@section source_folder Application examples

Applications exist in source/ subfolders, named after application name. Note that not
all applications exist for every processor architecture.

Applications are categorized into two categories:
- @ref example_applications "Example applications" which can be used as a
  template for own application development. They are simple applications
  targeted to specific use case. They also include unitary apps.
- @ref production_apps "Demos and production apps". They are applications that
  are dedicated to specific purpose. Compared to example applications, they are
  relatively complex and mainly to be used as such.

@anchor example_applications

This page contains following sections:
- @subpage source_app_c
- @subpage source_config_mk
- @subpage source_makefile

@subsection source_app_c app.c

This file is present in all applications. Application init function and
its application callback functions should be implemented here as defined
in the <code>app.h</code> file.

@subsection source_config_mk config.mk

<code>config.mk</code> file is used to configure application compilation. Here,
the contents of that file have been described. Only fields that are common to
all applications are described here! Some applications may have own,
application-specific fields which are out of the scope of this documentation.
For example, content of the file could be following:

@code
# Define a specific application area_id
app_specific_area_id=0x8CEC79

# App version
app_major=1
app_minor=0
app_maintenance=0
app_development=0
@endcode

This page contains following sections:
- @subpage app_specific_area_id
- @subpage app_version
- @subpage app_target_boards

@subsection app_specific_area_id app_specific_area_id

Wirepas network supports <I>Over The Air</I> (OTAP) updates of devices on the
network.

A network can contain heterogenous devices (different types of sensors,
for example), so various different kinds of applications can coexist
simultaneously in a network.

Even when upgrading a subset of nodes in the network (just nodes with a
specific type of sensor, for example), all nodes will receive the update
image. This is to ensure that all nodes on the network receive the
update image, due to the multi-hop nature of the network. Consequently,
it is crucial for a node to know if the received image, called a
<I>scratchpad</I>, contains any updates for the node in question. This is the
purpose of the application area ID.

More information about <I>Over The Air Protocol</I> can be found in \ref
relmat1 "[1]".

Each new application <B>must</B> define its own
<code>app_specific_area_id</code> in its <code>config.mk</code> file. It is a
random 24-bit field that must have its most significant bit set to 1 (MSB to 0
is reserved for Wirepas):

@code
    # Define a specific application area_id
    app_specific_area_id=0x83744C
@endcode

This specific area ID will be used in two different places:

- The <I>bootloader</I>, which contains a list of area IDs that it
  accepts, when a new scratchpad is processed. All the nodes that will
  be flashed with the image generated from an
  application build (containing the bootloader) will *only* accept
  updates of the application matching the specific area ID defined in
  <code>config.mk</code>.

- In the <I>scratchpad generation tool</I> (@ref genscratchpad.py),
  where it identifies the application scratchpad image. All the
  <code>*.otap</code> images generated from this application build will be
  only accepted by nodes flashed with a bootloader matching this area
  ID.

The <code>app_specific_area_id</code> is only part of the scratchpad area id
existing on the device. The whole scratchpad area id is composed on 4 bytes,
as following:

<table>
<tr><th>byte #</th><th>content</th></tr>
<tr><td>MSB byte 0</td><td>app_specific_area_id MSB byte 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>byte 1</td><td>app_specific area id byte 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>byte 2</td><td>app_specific area id LSB byte 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>byte 3 LSB</td>
<td>hardware magic (see @ref app_lib_system_hardware_magic_e)</td></tr>
</table>

For example, if <code>app_specific_area_id</code> has value of <code>0x83744C
</code> and used hardware is Nordic nRF52 (i.e. @ref
app_lib_system_hardware_magic_e is @ref
APP_LIB_SYSTEM_HARDWARE_MAGIC_NRF52832_SP_2), the resulted area id stored in the
devices is:
@code
(0x83744C << 8) | 3 = 0x83744C03
@endcode

To summarize, in order to have unique scratchpad image on the device, the image
*must have*
- Unique <code>app_specific_area_id</code> OR
- Unique processor architecture.

If, however, same application is built on different board (but having same
processor architecture), it will result same area id and otap mechanism cannot
disinguish the images from others.

@note It is up to each customer to maintain
its own set of <code>app_area_id</code> to avoid mismatch between its
applications.

@subsection app_version Application version

Following definitions:

@code
# App version
app_major=1
app_minor=0
app_maintenance=0
app_development=0
@endcode

define the version of the application software. It is different from stack
software and is application- specific. This information can be used to pinpoint
which version of the application is running on the device.

@subsection app_target_boards TARGET_BOARDS

This configuration defines the @ref board_folder "boards" which application
supports. Configuration is optional.

@note If configuration is not present, it equals that it is supported on _every_
board available. Usually that is not the case so it is better to ensure that
only boards supported are listed here. Then, if incorrect board is tried to be
compiled, it is ensured that compilation fails.

Example:
@code
TARGET_BOARDS := pca10056 pca10059 pca10040 wirepas_brd4254a silabs_brd4254a tbsense2 ublox_b204 promistel_rpi_hat
@endcode

@section tools_folder Tools

This folder contains various tools, mainly implemented in Python, used during
build process of the application.

This page contains following sections:
- @subpage genscratchpad_py
- @subpage config_mk_ini_file

@subsection genscratchpad_py genscratchpad.py

@ref genscratchpad.py "This tool", used by the @ref makefile "Makefile", allows
the scratchpad binary generation for the OTAP update. It uses the
<code>ini</code> file in the same directory

@subsection config_mk_ini_file INI_FILE

All scratchpad images received <I>Over The Air</I> are compressed and
encrypted.

The bootloader authenticates the image and decrypts it, so
authentication and encryption keys used to generate a scratchpad must
match the ones stored in the bootloader.

The list of keys stored in bootloader can be configured at the end of
<code>tools/scratchpad_\<mcu\>.ini</code> file. The bootloader can contain several
keys and will decrypt a received scratchpad, if it can be authenticated
with any of the listed keys.

By default, each application uses the same <code>.ini</code> file stored in
<code>tools/scratchpad_\<mcu\>.ini</code> but it can be copied to the application
folder and modified as needed. The new <code>.ini</code> file can be specified
from the application as following:

@code
    # Define a specific scratchpad ini
    INI_FILE = $(APP_SRCS_PATH)/scratchpad_custom.ini
@endcode

The scratchpad generated from an application build use the key named
<code>default</code> from the <code>.ini</code> file. It can be changed by
adding the <code>--keyname</code> option to the invocation of
<code>genscratchpad.py</code> script from makefile.
