@page sdk_environment SDK Environment setup

As a prerequisite for this guide, you must be able to successfully build
one of the provided application example from the SDK.

This page contains following sections:
- @subpage installation_of_sdk_environment
- @subpage flashing_guideline
- @subpage nordic_resources

@section installation_of_sdk_environment Installation of SDK Environment

To ease the management of SDK environement, Wirepas maintains a docker image with
all the required dependencies installed.

For more information to use it, please read guidance from <a href="https://developer.wirepas.com/support/solutions/articles/77000435375">
Wirepas Helpdesk.</a>

It is also possible to install requirement in your native environement but it is not described here.
Requirement are listed in Github SDK main page under Requirement section.

@section nordic_resources Resources on Nordic nRF52

The nRF52 chip version supported by Wirepas Mesh has minimum 512kB of flash and
64kB of RAM.

This page contains following sections:
- @subpage flash_memory_nrf52
- @subpage ram_memory_nrf52
- @subpage peripherals_accessible_by_stack_only
- @subpage peripherals_shared_between_the_stack_and_the_application
- @subpage peripherals_available_for_the_application

@subsection flash_memory_nrf52 Flash Memory available for application on nRF52

As stated in @ref memory_partitioning "description of memory partitioning", the
available flash memory for application is limited by size of the memory area
that is used commonly for application and also scratchpad image. If application
size is too large, there is possibility that large scratchpad image will
override application image. The default maximum size of the application has been
set so that it is always safe to use scratchpad image that will contain both
firmware and application.

The _recommended_ maximum size of @ref flash_memory "flash memory" for an
application, according to processor type is following:

<table>
<tr><th>Processor</th><th>Flash memory</th></tr>
<tr><td>nRF52832</td><td>50kB</td></tr>
<tr><td>nRF52833</td><td>50kB</td></tr>
<tr><td>nRF52840</td><td>256kB</td></tr>
</table>

@subsection ram_memory_nrf52 RAM Memory available for application on nRF52

Allocated @ref ram_memory "RAM memory" for application by the processor is
following:
<table>
<tr><th>Processor</th><th>RAM memory</th></tr>
<tr><td>nRF52832</td><td>Up to 16 kB (8 kB by default)</td></tr>
<tr><td>nRF52833</td><td>72 kB</td></tr>
<tr><td>nRF52840</td><td>188 kB</td></tr>
</table>

@subsection peripherals_accessible_by_stack_only Peripherals accessible by stack only

Some peripherals are used by the Wirepas Mesh stack and cannot be
used by the application.

<table>
<tr><th>Peripheral</th><th>Associated interrupt (from file @ref mcu/nrf52/vendor/nrf52.h)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Power</td><td><code>POWER_CLOCK_IRQn</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Radio</td><td><code>RADIO_IRQn</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Timer0</td><td><code>TIMER0_IRQn</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>WDT</td><td><code>WDT_IRQn</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Rtc1</td><td><code>RTC1_IRQn</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>ECB (AES)</td><td><code>ECB_IRQn</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>PPI (Channels 0, 1 and 2)</td><td><code>None</code></td></tr>
</table>

All the internal interrupt of cortex M are handled by the stack
directly (NMI, HardFault,...)

@subsection peripherals_shared_between_the_stack_and_the_application Peripherals Shared between the stack and the application

Some peripherals are used by the stack but can also be accessed by the
application.

Random Number Generator RNG (nRF52) and True Random Number Generator TRNG (EFR32)
are available for application to use within App_init function.
After App_init returns, these peripherals are reserved for Wirepas Mesh stack and
all initializations done in App_init may be overwritten.
Application may also take the control of RNG/TRNG by initializing the peripheral in
scheduled task after App_init has returned and after Wirepas Mesh stack has started.
Do note that initialization must not take place within interrupt context as interrupt
could be served before these peripherals are released from Wirepas Mesh stack usage.

@subsection peripherals_available_for_the_application Peripherals available for the application

All the other peripherals not listed above are free to be used by the application.

@subsection peripherals_shared_between_the_stack_and_the_application2 Peripherals Shared between the stack and the application

Some peripherals are used by the stack but can also be accessed by the application.

These peripherals must be reserved through the API before being used and the application must initialize them each time after reserving it. In fact, the stack may configure them differently.

It is also important to avoid long reservation of theses peripherals to let the stack use them for its own purpose.

<tr><td>ADC0</td><td>@ref APP_LIB_HARDWARE_PERIPHERAL_ADC</td></tr>

@subsection peripherals_available_for_the_application2 Peripherals available for the application

All the other peripherals not listed above are free to be used by the application.
